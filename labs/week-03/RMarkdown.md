# *RMarkdown* files
This week's instructional material (and subsequent weeks also) is available both as plain [Markdown](00-introducing-spatstat.md) (`.md`) and as [RMarkdown](00-introducing-spatstat.Rmd) (.Rmd) files.

The plain Markdown is readable on the github website, and you can simply follow the instructions and read along with those if you choose. I would encourage you to do this for now, to continue to familiarise yourself with *R* code.

The RMarkdown is really, really cool, however! The quick explanation is that you can

+ Open and RMarkdown file in *RStudio*
+ Run code chunks one at a time without typing
+ *Knit* the whole thing into an output document that includes all the code and all the outputs produced in a single neatly formatted document

There are a few wrinkles to this, not the least of which is that you will need to install some packages, and you have to pay attention to things like web maps (you can't embed these in a Word document, for example. You may also find you can't make PDFs in Windows, or Word documents in Linux, and so on.

However... we will spend a little bit of time on this in the session, and it is an option I would encourage you to consider using for the submission of assignments in this class (although there are a few *caveats* around that which I will discuss.)
