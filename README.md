# GISC 422 Spatial Analysis and Modelling
This class introduces key concepts and methods of spatial analysis. Practical deployment in the `R` statistical analysis software package is emphasised, although other tools will be surveyed.

## Lecture and lab schedule
Lectures are in Cotton 110 at 10AM on Mondays and will be followed immediately by related lab sessions in the same location.

Here's the trimester schedule we will aim to follow. **Bolded labs** have an associated assignment that must be submitted and contributes the indicated percentage of the course credit.  Relevant materials (lecture slides, lab scripts and datasets) are linked below, when available.

| 3 Jun | **No class** Queen's Birthday | **Final assignment** (40%) | Due 14 Jun |

## Lectures
Lectures will generally consist of around an hour of presented material, and around 30 minutes of more open-ended discussion and Q&A based on the materials and on reading which students will have been expected to do ahead of class.

### Readings
Details of any required readings will be provided ahead of class and where possible either publicly available, or linked from [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/). Most readings will be from one or the other of

+ Bivand R, Pebesma E and GÃ³mez-Rubilio V. 2013. [*Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R*](https://link-springer-com.helicon.vuw.ac.nz/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7618-4) 2nd edn. Springer, New York.
+ O'Sullivan D and D Unwin. 2010. [*Geographic Information Analysis*](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470288574.html) 2nd edn. Wiley, Hoboken, NJ.

The first of these is freely available as a full PDF download from the library, so where possible I will emphasise materials in that book. I wrote the second book and will provide pre-publication manuscript chapters where needed.

A third book:

+ Brunsdon C and L Comber. 2018. [*An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping*](https://au.sagepub.com/en-gb/oce/an-introduction-to-r-for-spatial-analysis-and-mapping/book241031) 2nd edn. Sage, London.

is more recent and is reasonably affordable, so you might consider purchasing it as a general reference and reminder of topics covered in the class.

There are also many useful online resources that cover topics that are the subject of this class. For example:

+ [*Spatial Data Science*](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.com/intro.html) a book in preparation from Bivand and Pebesma
+ [Course materials for Geographic Data Science](http://darribas.org/gds15/) by Daniel Arribas-Bel at University of Liverpool
+ [*Geospatial Analysis*](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/HTML/index.html) by deSmith, Longley and Goodchild

For the final assignment you will need to do your own research and assemble materials concerning how spatial analysis has been applied in specific areas of study.

## Labs
Lab sessions follow the lecture sessions and will cover related practical topics. Only four sessions have an associated assessed assignment, but you should attend all labs and particpate fully to broaden your knowledge of GIScience methods and tools as any of the approaches covered may prove useful for you in other parts of the program.

## Assessment
Assessment is based on four lab assignments worth 10% of overall course credit each, and a final assignment worth 40% of course credit due in the exam period.

The remaining 20% of course credit will be awarded for participation in lecture sessions and in the unassessed lab sessions. These sessions will also be important for your ability to complete the final assignment effectively and to your all-around training in GIScience, so it is vital that you take them seriously as part of the course.
