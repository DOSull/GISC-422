# GISC 422 Spatial Analysis and Modelling
This repository contains materials for the practical sessions associated with this class, first taught at Victoria University of Wellington in Trimester 1 (March-June) 2019.
In some cases, where datasets are not shareable (for whatever reason) these may have to be downloaded from the campus course management system [Blackboard](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/).
Lecture slides for the class are available at [this site](http://southosullivan.com/geodos/gisc-422-spatial-analysis-and-modelling.html).
